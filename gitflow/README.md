## How to iniate Git Flow  
  
```
git flow init
```
  
The git flow init command is used to initialize a new Git repository with Git Flow, which defines a set of branching conventions designed to optimize collaboration, release management, and issue tracking in software development projects.

## Basic command  
  
```
git flow feature start (name)
```  
  
The git flow feature start command is used to create a new feature branch in a Git repository.  
Features in Git Flow are used to develop new functionality or make significant changes to the codebase. Using feature branches helps keep the development work isolated from the main branches (develop and master), allowing teams to work on different features independently.
